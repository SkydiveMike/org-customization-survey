org-customization-survey
========================

Submit your Org mode customizations as part of an Org mode developer survey
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This function will report on the Org mode customizations in your
running copy of Emacs and email the result to Mike McLean.

I will report the results, in the aggregate, on the Org mode mailing
list to assist the Org developers in understanding what Org features
people use, and how they use them.

To submit your results, evaluate and then execute this function. The
function will create its output in a buffer. If your Emacs is
configured for sending email, C-c C-c will send it.

If your email is not configured for sending email, then manually send
the contents of the buffer to mike.mclean@pobox.com.
